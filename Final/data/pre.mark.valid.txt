 the beginning of the good news of jesus christ , the son of god . 
 as it is written in the prophet isaiah , 
 see , i am sending my messenger ahead of you , 
 who will prepare your way ; 
 the voice of one crying out in the wilderness : 
 prepare the way of the lord , 
 make his paths straight , 
 john the baptizer appeared in the wilderness , proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins . 
 and people from the whole judean countryside and all the people of jerusalem were going out to him , and were baptized by him in the river jordan , confessing their sins . 
 now john was clothed with camels hair , with a leather belt around his waist , and he ate locusts and wild honey . 
 he proclaimed , the one who is more powerful than i is coming after me ; i am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals . 
 i have baptized you with water ; but he will baptize you with the holy spirit . 
 in those days jesus came from nazareth of galilee and was baptized by john in the jordan . 
 and just as he was coming up out of the water , he saw the heavens torn apart and the spirit descending like a dove on him . 
 and a voice came from heaven , you are my son , the beloved ; with you i am well pleased . 
 and the spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness . 
 he was in the wilderness forty days , tempted by satan ; and he was with the wild beasts ; and the angels waited on him . 
 now after john was arrested , jesus came to galilee , proclaiming the good news of god , and saying , the time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of god has come near ; repent , and believe in the good news . 
 as jesus passed along the sea of galilee , he saw simon and his brother andrew casting a net into the sea-for they were fishermen . 
 and jesus said to them , follow me and i will make you fish for people . 
 and immediately they left their nets and followed him . 
 as he went a little farther , he saw james son of zebedee and his brother john , who were in their boat mending the nets . 
 immediately he called them ; and they left their father zebedee in the boat with the hired men , and followed him .
