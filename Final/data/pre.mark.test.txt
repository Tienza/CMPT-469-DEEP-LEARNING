 they went to capernaum ; and when the sabbath came , he entered the synagogue and taught . 
 they were astounded at his teaching , for he taught them as one having authority , and not as the scribes . 
 just then there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit , and he cried out , what have you to do with us , jesus of nazareth ? 
 have you come to destroy us ? 
 i know who you are , the holy one of god . 
 but jesus rebuked him , saying , be silent , and come out of him ! 
 and the unclean spirit , convulsing him and crying with a loud voice , came out of him . 
 they were all amazed , and they kept on asking one another , what is this ? 
 a new teaching-with authority ! 
 he commands even the unclean spirits , and they obey him . 
 at once his fame began to spread throughout the surrounding region of galilee . 
 as soon as they left the synagogue , they entered the house of simon and andrew , with james and john . 
 now simons mother-in-law was in bed with a fever , and they told him about her at once . 
 he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up . 
 then the fever left her , and she began to serve them . 
 that evening , at sundown , they brought to him all who were sick or possessed with demons . 
 and the whole city was gathered around the door . 
 and he cured many who were sick with various diseases , and cast out many demons ; and he would not permit the demons to speak , because they knew him . 
 in the morning , while it was still very dark , he got up and went out to a deserted place , and there he prayed . 
 and simon and his companions hunted for him . 
 when they found him , they said to him , everyone is searching for you . 
 he answered , let us go on to the neighboring towns , so that i may proclaim the message there also ; for that is what i came out to do . 
 and he went throughout galilee , proclaiming the message in their synagogues and casting out demons . 
 a leper came to him begging him , and kneeling he said to him , if you choose , you can make me clean . 
 moved with pity , jesus stretched out his hand and touched him , and said to him , i do choose . 
 be made clean ! 
 immediately the leprosy left him , and he was made clean . 
 after sternly warning him he sent him away at once , saying to him , see that you say nothing to anyone ; but go , show yourself to the priest , and offer for your cleansing what moses commanded , as a testimony to them . 
 but he went out and began to proclaim it freely , and to spread the word , so that jesus could no longer go into a town openly , but stayed out in the country ; and people came to him from every quarter .
